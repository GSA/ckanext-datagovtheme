<div id="datasets-disclaimer">
  This page features datasets from participating State and local governments
  and non-governmental organizations, such as universities, as well as the
  Federal Government. Datasets from non-Federal Government participants are not
  Federal Government data and are not subject to the Data.gov Data Policy. Each
  non-Federal participant maintains its own data policy. It is important that
  users understand the data policies of participating entities in order to best
  utilize these datasets. The category of the data provider is clearly marked
  by a banner (e.g. "Federal," "State," "University" etc.).
